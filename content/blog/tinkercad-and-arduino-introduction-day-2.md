During our second session, we dug into practical applications of the acquired knowledge from day 1. We essentially built a lightning system, a detection system with a PIR sensor, and finally a bluetooth-controlled system.

## Conclusion

We learned a lot during that two-days session, and it was a lot of fun too! I hope you enjoy your stay on this journey! Let's catch up soon in future posts!
