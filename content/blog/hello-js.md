# Hello JS

Welcome to my second blog post! This is a sample post to demonstrate the markdown blog system. And everything works so far!

## Features

- Markdown support
- Code syntax highlighting
- Tags support
- Automatic date formatting

```javascript
// Example code block
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
